 Build-up audio effects with looper function.
 The idea behind this plugin is driven by EZBot's Performance mixer for the Octatrack, where the device is used as a complex effect's chain for transitions during live performances.
 
 When you start the bpm synced looper, the looped audio could be send through a sequence of effects:
 1. Distortion (Frequency shifter, Distortion, Wavefolder)
 2. Amplitude modulation (Stutter, Ping pong stutter, Panning of stereo signal)
 3. Filtering (Low pass, High pass, band pass, notch, flanger, phaser - could be used parallel)
 4. Delay (adjustable ping pong)
 5. Reverb

These effects are modulated during a build-up sequence, the length of which can be choosen. The result is for example a closing low pass filter loop which is closing during the length of the build-up. Mostly usable for transitions, because the looper plays instead of the original signal, and you can change the instrument parameters of the original signal during the transition. At the end of the transition you switch back to original sound.

You also can add on some sort of extra audio source to the build-up loop, for example a low cut noise, to add some more interest into the build-up.
